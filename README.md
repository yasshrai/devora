## ✨ Overview

**Devora** is a Fedora-based Linux distribution designed to eliminate the time-consuming setup process that comes with a fresh Linux installation. Instead of spending hours configuring GNOME, installing extensions, and tweaking settings, Devora provides a production-ready desktop environment that works perfectly from the moment you boot it up.

### Why Devora?

Setting up a new Linux installation with GNOME can be incredibly time-consuming. You need to:
- Install and configure GNOME extensions
- Apply various tweaks and optimizations
- Adjust settings for productivity
- Test and fine-tune everything

Many users either give up or settle for a suboptimal setup. **Devora solves this problem** by providing a pre-configured, polished experience that's ready to use immediately.
